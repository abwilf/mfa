- So, you brought flowers
and then I'm told now

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.566
there's another gift?

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.233
- Yep, I have another gift
for you for--

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:06.566
happy birthday again,
by the way.

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.933
So, we all know Ellen's
an incredible woman, right?

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.200
[cheers and applause]

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.033
Well, she was honored
at the People's Choice Award,

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:17.100
and she was given
the "World's Favorite Human."

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.533
- No.
[both laugh]

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.133
- Nope, I'm kidding.
"World's Favorite Humanitarian,"

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.266

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.866
[Taylor Swift's
"Out of the Woods"]

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.500
- I started out as a comedian,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.100
and I wanted
to make people happy,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.033
and I wanted
to make people laugh,

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:36.066
and this has turned into
something so much better for me,

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.500
that I get
to change people's lives.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.300
- I just want to say thank you,
because for five years,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.266
you've been my chemo buddy
every night,

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.400
and you've helped me
go to sleep with a laugh.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.366
I just thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.700
- Thank you.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.700
[music continues]

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.700
- [singing]
The rest of the world

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.800
Is black and white

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.133
But we were in screaming color
